## Overview

This repo contains a set of contracts to facilitate on-chain Loans between Maple Finance Pools and institutional borrowers. These contracts contain logic to:
1. Deploy new Loans.
2. Perform Loan funding.
3. Draw down funds.
4. Manage collateral.
5. Calculate payment amounts and schedules (can handle amortized and interest-only payment structures).
6. Perform repossessions of collateral and remaining funds in a defaulted Loan.
7. Claim interest and principal from Loans.
8. Perform refinancing operations when a lender and borrower agree to new terms.
9. Upgrade Loan logic using upgradeability patterns.

## Dependencies/Inheritance

Contracts in this repo inherit and import code from:
- [`maple-labs/erc20`](https://github.com/maple-labs/erc20)
- [`maple-labs/erc20-helper`](https://github.com/maple-labs/erc20-helper)
- [`maple-labs/maple-proxy-factory`](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-proxy-factory)

Contracts inherit and import code in the following ways:
- `MapleLoan` and `MapleLoanFeeManager` use `IERC20` and `ERC20Helper` for token interactions.
- `MapleLoan` inherits `MapleProxiedInternals` for proxy logic.
- `MapleLoanFactory` inherits `MapleProxyFactory` for proxy deployment and management.

Versions of dependencies can be checked with `git submodule status`.

## Setup

This project was built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Refer to installation instructions [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maple-labs/loan.git

## Running Tests
- To run all tests: `forge test`
- To run specific tests: `forge test --match <test_name>`

`./scripts/test.sh` is used to enable Foundry profile usage with the `-p` flag. Profiles are used to specify the number of fuzz runs.
